	abstract = {Functional genomics assays based on high-throughput sequencing greatly expand our ability to understand the genome. Here, we define the ENCODE blacklist- a comprehensive set of regions in the human, mouse, worm, and fly genomes that have anomalous, unstructured, or high signal in next-generation sequencing experiments independent of cell line or experiment. The removal of the ENCODE blacklist is an essential quality measure when analyzing functional genomics data.},
